# Redux

This application uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as global state container.

## Schema (how it works?)

                        7 Action result updates the state

## Involved parts:

-   **A** – Component, NC: `Feature.component.js` – implements the data display functional

-   **B** – Container, NC: `Feature.container.js` – relates the component with Redux global state

-   _unmentioned_ – Action Declaration, NC: `Feature.action.js` – declare action interface (arguments and returned values)

-   **C** – Action Dispatcher, NC: `Feature.dispatcher.js` – dispatches the Redux global state actions

-   **D** – Action Reducer, NC: `Feature.reducer.js` – handles the state update, applies Redux action results to global state

-   **E** – Utility / Helper function, NC: `Helper.js` – utility functional which implements the common logic

\*NC – Naming convention

## Data pass through:

1.  User input (`User -> A`)

2.  Global state changing user interaction (`A -> B`)

3.  Event payload is passed to asynchronous action dispatcher (`B -> C`)

4.  Helpers are invoked (`C -> E`)

5.  Asynchronous response is returned from helper (`E -> C`)

6.  Action is dispatched (`C -> D`, `B -> D`)

7.  Action result updates the state (`D -> B`)

8.  Container updates props of child component (`B -> A`)

## Tools

There is a [browser extension](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) for Redux debugging. For it work, application has to be run in `development` mode.
